Question 1: 
We can check if two strings are anagram by counting number of characters of the strings. After we count the characters,
we need to compare the substring from the main string. The substring will have the same length as the string which
we are comparing to. If any set of the compared string is an anagram of the main string, then return true else false.
The comparison of the characters will be done in constant time. The for loop will have O(len(original_string)) in
the worst case. So the time complexity for this program is O(n), where n is the length of the main string. The space
complexity of the alogrithm will be a constant, i.e. O(1) as we are storing the strings and their respective lengths
only.
